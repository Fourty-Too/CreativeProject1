  <h1>What You'll Need</h1>

  <img src="../images/90.jpeg" class="center">

  <p>If you're ready to dive into the fantastic world of origami, there are a few things
    you will need to have. First, you will need two hands, and a mind that's ready to dive
    in!
  </p>

  <h3>The Essentials</h3>

  <p>For every model, you are going to need some paper and some diagrams. You can
    find a good beginner origami book at your local bookstore, or you can visit our
    Diagrams page for a good starting place.
  </p>

  <p> We strongly recommend buying some good origami paper. We're often asked
    if there's any significant difference between regular printer paper and origami paper.
    The answer is a resounding yes! Origami paper is much thinner than printer paper, which
    makes it easier to fold more complex models. You may not notice it when you
    are folding a simple crane, but the better you get at origami, the more necessary
    origami paper will be.
  </p>

  <p>For most models, you will want standard paper that is at least
    a 6in x 6in square, with color on one side and white on the other. Other sizes and types
    of paper (such as foil-backed) do exist, and are useful for certain complex models, but
    for most models you will just want standard origami paper.
  </p>

  <h3>Other Helpful Items</h3>

  <p> Some other helpful items we recommend you have on hand are a pair of scissors,
    a pencil, and a ruler. Somtimes a model will require a paper shape other than square
    or you will only have rectangular paper, and so it is good to have some scissors on
    hand. A ruler and pencil are useful for marking places on the paper for folds,
    especially when you are first starting out or your model calls for an unusual dimension
    (such as folding 1/3 of the layer down). A ruler is also helpful for smoothing out creases,
    though your fingernail will work just as well in most cases.
